# ft_printf
a small reproduction of printf

ft_printf is a custom implementation of the standard C `printf` function, developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. This project focuses on mastering formatted output by handling variable argument lists and multiple format specifiers.

## Features

- Supports standard conversion specifiers such as `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%p`, and `%%`.
- Handles flags, width, precision, and length modifiers.
- Manages variable argument lists using `stdarg.h`.
- Produces formatted output to standard output with correct behavior.
- Includes robust error handling and edge case management.

## Purpose

The ft_printf project aims to deepen understanding of C variadic functions, formatted output, and string manipulation. It provides a foundation for creating flexible and efficient output routines in C programs.
